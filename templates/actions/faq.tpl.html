					<li class="active">
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">What services do you provide?</a>
						<div class="answer">We design, build, renovate and permit commercial, residential, and governmental buildings. We are well known for constructing luxury buildings.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">Are there any "hidden fees" that Goal Construction charges?</a>
						<div class="answer">No, we provide the details of all fees up-front prior to start of the project.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">When should I contact Goal Construction to begin the planning process?</a>
						<div class="answer">As soon as you know that you are going to build a house or start a new project, preferably right around the time you purchase or are about to purchase your land or existing property. We will help you select the right plan whether it is residential or commercial that will be suited to your needs and will make any desired architectural modifications if needed. We will explain the construction process in details and will educate you on the potential costs involved with site work and county fees. By coming to us early in the process, you will be assured not to waste time and money that is outside your budget.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">Which areas do you cover?</a>
						<div class="answer">DC metropolitan area.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">How much money do I need upfront to start a project with Goal Construction?</a>
						<div class="answer">It varies. It depends on the project.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">How long does it take to complete a project?</a>
						<div class="answer">When we do construction after beginning an excavation, it is our goal to be done in about 5-10 months. When weather is extremely cooperative and you are on top of a few responsibilities, we could finish in about 5 to 6 months. These estimates are subject to change depending on the specifications of the project.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">How do your prices compare to other builders?</a>
						<div class="answer">While most custom builders charge anywhere from $150 to $350 or more per square foot, our pricing starts at about $120 per square foot. This is not because we compromise on quality in any way. It is because we understand the real costs of building new homes inside and out. We build well-constructed homes that are cost effective to build. Most custom builders, however, are building each home or building for the first time and have to add on additional costs for variances (the unknowns) during construction. This is the part we cut out and where you save. Above that, our construction quality, homeowner satisfaction, and overall value for the dollar are unmatched in the building industry. This same effective and competitive way of building process is also applied to any kind of commercial or governmental projects that we complete.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">Can we use a contractor or supplier that is not a Goal Construction preferred one?</a>
						<div class="answer">We strongly believe that our contractors and suppliers are the best in the business and we will not sacrifice the quality of their work to use someone else. Our subcontractors have been carefully screened and many have been working with us for years and have built a reputation of providing superb quality and workmanship. Additionally, since we primarily use the same subcontractors for all of our projects, we obtain consistently high quality which has earned us an excellent reputation in the industry.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">Can you help me find a lot or a tear-down home to build a new house?</a>
						<div class="answer">If you are looking for land or a tear-down on which to build, come see us. We can help you narrow down the house or building types which you are interested in so that you can better figure out what lot size and shape meet your needs best.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">How does financing work?</a>
						<div class="answer">When it comes to financing, building on your own lot can save you a significant amount of money. If you are tearing down your existing home, you can use the equity you have built up to avoid putting a down payment which ultimately leads to reducing your interest rate. Even if you are buying a lot or tear-down on which to build, the savings from building on your lot means that you may be able to reduce your down payment and perhaps even your interest rate. The loan you would receive is called a Construction-to-Permanent loan. It is very similar to a mortgage except that instead of paying all at once, it pays out in installments as the home is constructed. When the project is complete, the loan becomes a normal end loan similar to a mortgage. The rates and terms are the same as what is available for mortgages except that you have more flexibility to do things; for example, rolling in payments during construction and adding allowances for other items such as adding a deck or landscaping.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">Will you build from my own plans?</a>
						<div class="answer">We will review your plans and determine whether we are the right builder for you. Prices may be higher for completely custom homes, but this is not always the case. We would love to be given the opportunity to build your dream home, whether it is one of our models or your own. Usually there are no extra fees associated with bringing your own plans.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">If I want to make changes to any of the floor plans or designs, what are the costs involved?</a>
						<div class="answer">Usually there are architectural or design fees associated with any significant changes to the original plans or designs due to new drawings required. The amount can vary; however, it is usually between $1500 to $5000 depending on the amount and type of changes.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">What other costs should I be aware of if I decide to build on my own lot?</a>
						<div class="answer">You need to consider site work (any work that must be done on your lot such as demolition, connecting to utilities, site plans, landscaping, and etc) and county fees. These costs vary depending on lot conditions and county regulations. We can assist you in determining an approximate range of costs.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="javascript:void(0)">How do I go about completing my site work? Do you assist with this?</a>
						<div class="answer">We are heavily involved with you right from the beginning and well before the start of construction. We will help you manage and complete your site work and we do not charge any management fees. We allow our customers to hire the contractors of their choice if needed and pay them directly. We receive no kickbacks or commissions from the contractors we refer you to for completing your site work. We know this may be your first time ever building a home; therefore, we want this to be a smooth process for you. Don't worry - we're there with you all the way!</div>
